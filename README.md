# JS walkman music player (WIP)

an attempt of making a functional js music player with the look of one of those sony walkman mp3 players for html.

it will look similar to the [last.fm widget](https://github.com/biancarosa/lastfm-last-played) i currently have on my homepage but hopefully i can make it be functional and also make the ui be more accurate to the ones around 2008.

my fun little summer project.
